# CrownJewel-2 HTB Writeup

## Summary


SIEM systems alerted us to a mismatch between the IP source and the workstation name.  
We are given a `.pcap` file and an `.evtx` file.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Step 1 ‚Äì Download and Extract

```bash
wget [link-to-file]
```

Password: `hacktheblue`

There‚Äôs no README included, so we proceed directly to analysis.

---

## Step 2 ‚Äì Provided Files

- `ntmlrelay.pcapng` ‚Äì We will use Wireshark to analyze this file.  
- `security.evtx` ‚Äì We will use Timeline Explorer to analyze this file.

---

## Step 3: Analyzing `.evtx`

We use **EvtxECmd** to convert all `.evtx` files into a consolidated CSV file, which we‚Äôll explore with **Timeline Explorer**

```bash
.\EvtxECmd.exe -d "path-to-folder" --csv "path-to-output" --csvf merging.csv
```
